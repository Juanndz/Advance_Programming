# Description of the project.

 This project has the objetive to replicate a Online Notes Platform, applying all the concepts already seen in the course [Advance Programming](https://github.com/EngAndres/ud-public/tree/main/courses/advanced-programming), implementing the knowlegde on Frontend, Backend, Data bases, Documentation and creation of UML diagrams. 

This project is based on the platform Notion his takes care to creating of templates, calendars and workspace to management the personal information or colletive projects. Is design to help all people to give a order in his objetives and tasks. 

This project will be developed through the Python programming language, it will be supported by platforms for the creation and modeling of UML diagrams on the [draw.io](http://draw.io/) website, in turn, there will be a repository created on the GitHub platform for the management and control of team versions and for effective software improvement.
 
## Business Model.

- Allow to the users to creates Notes, order and having different shapes to do it, like texts, boards, lists, etc.
- Capacity of personalitation for differents workflows, and organization styles.
- Have a calendar that organizes and notifies tasks and events.
- Some of the features are limited, such as the number of people sharing the same template, more advanced customization, among others.
- Implement a subscription model where users pay a recurring fee, monthly or annually, to access all the features of the application.
- Include in-app advertisements, content sponsorships, or collaborations with related brands.
- Various membership plans, whether annual, monthly, semi-annual, with the characteristics that the user wants (Free of advertising, Access to templates,)

## Goals

Create, develop and simulate an existing App, implementing all the knowledge taught about design criteria, models and creation of UML diagrams, Good programming practices, Documentation, virtual environment management, among others. 

Implement efficient backend architectures, database optimizations and good storage mechanisms. 
Facilitate the abstraction of complex information for software design, thus increasing usability, accessibility, scope and scalability.
